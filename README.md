# Zombiecalypse Appetite

## Description:
Zombiecalypse Appetite is a simple collecting game written in Lua using LÃ–VE 2D framework. The objective is to collect as many brains as possible while avoiding falling anvils. Every 15 generated brains increase the game difficulty. The player has three chances to get hit, and if that happens, the game stops. To diversify gameplay, a dash option has been added. Each collected brain is worth 50 points. The "classic" external library is used to simplify entity creation, making gameplay modification easier and the code cleaner. Images, audio, and font are sourced from external providers with free licenses.
